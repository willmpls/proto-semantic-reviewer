title: Field Behavior
summary: |
  Fields should be annotated with their behavior: REQUIRED, OPTIONAL, OUTPUT_ONLY,
  INPUT_ONLY, IMMUTABLE. This documents the field's contract clearly.

rules:
  - id: AIP-203-OUTPUT-ONLY
    description: Server-generated fields should be OUTPUT_ONLY

    violations:
      - "create_time without OUTPUT_ONLY annotation"
      - "Server-computed fields that clients shouldn't set"
    good_example: "google.protobuf.Timestamp create_time = 5 [(google.api.field_behavior) = OUTPUT_ONLY];"

  - id: AIP-203-REQUIRED
    description: Required fields should be annotated as REQUIRED
    check_guidance: Fields that must be set should have REQUIRED annotation

  - id: AIP-203-IMMUTABLE
    description: Fields that cannot be changed after creation should be IMMUTABLE
